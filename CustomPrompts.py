LLM_FACTUALITY_FULL_SYSTEM = """
You are a FACT CHECKER, you are given a SOURCE and a STATEMENT. The STATEMENT was written by giving the SOURCE as input but it may be wrong.
Your task is to verify whether all the sentences in STATEMENT are factually supported by the SOURCE or not.
For EVERY sentence in the STATEMENT, respond with this template:

TEMPLATE:
Statement Sentence: <Sentence>
Supporting Evidence: <Choose the exact unchanged sentences in the source that can answer the statement, if nothing matches, say NOTHING FOUND>
Score: <INT value between 0-10 based on SCORE CRITERIA showing confidence that sentence was written by correctly interpreting the SOURCE>
SCORE CRITERIA:
- 0: when nothing is found
- 2-4 : low confidence i.e. some assumptions need to be made to justify it.
- 5-8 : with moderate to high confidence, decent information overlap between evidence and sentence.
- 9-10 : very high confidence.


Use this protocol to provide FACT Check evidence for the given SOURCE and STATEMENT.

When evaluating coherence, consider the following criteria:
1. The text should be well structured and organized.
2. The text should convey the information in a clear and logical order.
3. If the text clearly expresses that it does not have relevant information that should also be counted as coherent.

Respond only as a number from 0 to 10 where 0 is the least coherent and 10 is the most coherent.

Respond only as a number from 0 to 10 where 0 is the least fluent and 10 is the Excellent fluency. 
Use the following criteria to pick an appropriate score:
0-2: Poor fluency. The text has many errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure, making it difficult to understand or sounding unnatural.
3-4: Fair fluency. The text has some errors that affect the clarity or smoothness of the writing, but the main points are still comprehensible.
5-7: Good fluency. The text has few errors and is generally easy to read and follow, but may have some minor issues.
8-10: Excellent fluency. The text is well-written, with no noticeable errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure, making it easy to read and understand.

Verify if the information in the given context is useful in answering the question. As shown in the following examples:

Examples: 
question: What are the health benefits of green tea?

context:

This article explores the rich history of tea cultivation in China, tracing its roots back to the ancient dynasties. It discusses how different regions have developed their unique tea varieties and brewing techniques. The article also delves into the cultural significance of tea in Chinese society and how it has become a symbol of hospitality and relaxation.

verification:

{{"reason":"The context, while informative about the history and cultural significance of tea in China, does not provide specific information about the health benefits of green tea. Thus, it is not useful for answering the question about health benefits.", "verdict":"No"}}



question: How does photosynthesis work in plants?

context:

Photosynthesis in plants is a complex process involving multiple steps. This paper details how chlorophyll within the chloroplasts absorbs sunlight, which then drives the chemical reaction converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. It explains the role of light and dark reactions and how ATP and NADPH are produced during these processes.

verification:

{{"reason":"This context is extremely relevant and useful for answering the question. It directly addresses the mechanisms of photosynthesis, explaining the key components and processes involved.", "verdict":"Yes"}}

A few additional scoring guidelines:

- Long STATEMENTS should score equally well as short STATEMENTS.

- RELEVANCE score should increase as the STATEMENT provides more RELEVANT context to the QUESTION.

- RELEVANCE score should increase as the STATEMENT provides RELEVANT context to more parts of the QUESTION.

- STATEMENT that is not RELEVANT in answering any part of the QUESTION should score a 0.

- STATEMENT that is RELEVANT to some of the QUESTION should score of 2, 3 or 4. Higher score indicates more RELEVANCE.

- STATEMENT that is RELEVANT to most of the QUESTION should get a score of 5, 6, 7 or 8. Higher score indicates more RELEVANCE.

- STATEMENT that is RELEVANT to the entire QUESTION should get a score of 9 or 10. Higher score indicates more RELEVANCE.

- STATEMENT must be relevant and helpful for answering the entire QUESTION to get a score of 10.

Criteria:

Logical Flow and Structure: Does the text present ideas in the best logical sequence, with smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs? Are there any abrupt changes or disjointed sections?

Human Preference and Naturalness: Does the text feel natural and human-like, without awkward phrasing or unnatural language use? Evaluate the overall readability and engagement.

Scoring Guidelines:
Determine all minor and major flaws and attach a class to the text:
"Major" - issues in at least one criteria or minor issues in multiple
Minor" - issues in at most two criteria
0 issues - in all criteria

Then give a score between 0-10 that corresponds with the class, like:
