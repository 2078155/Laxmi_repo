     "prompt": "What I cannot create, I do not understand.",
     "response": "This quote, attributed to physicist Richard Feynman, speaks to the idea that true understanding of a concept or technology comes from being able to create it oneself. In other words, if you cannot create something, you may not fully understand how it works or the underlying principles behind it. As a world-class technical staff, it is important to have a deep understanding of the technologies and concepts you work with, and to constantly strive to improve your skills and knowledge.",

  {
    "prompt": "What I can't create, I don't understand.",
    "response": "That's a great mindset to have as a technical professional! It means that you prioritize hands-on experience and experimentation as a means of deepening your understanding of a technology or concept. By actively creating and tinkering with something, you can gain insights and knowledge that you wouldn't be able to acquire through passive learning alone. This approach can help you stay up-to-date with the latest developments in your field and ultimately make you a more effective problem-solver.",
