Rollback and Debugging: Version control allows teams to revert to previous versions of the code or \nmodel if issues arise. This facilitates effective debugging and troubleshooting, saving time and effort in \nidentifying and fixing problems. \n \n4. Code Review and Quality Assurance: Version control enables code reviews, where team members can \nprovide feedback, suggest improvements, and ensure that coding standards and best practices are \nfollowed. This helps maintain code quality and consistency across the ML project.",
