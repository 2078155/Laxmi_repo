C:/AILA Share/AILA shared files/test.pdf,"Chapter 1: Getting started with Angular Remarks Angular (commonly referred to as ""Angular 
2+"" or ""Angular 2"") is a TypeScript-based open source front-end web framework led by the 
Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address all of 
the parts of the developer's workflow while building complex web applications. Angular is a 
complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. ยน The framework consists of several 
libraries, some of them core (@angular/core for example) and some optional 
(@angular/animations). You write Angular applications by composing HTML templates with 
Angularized markup, writing component classes to manage those templates, adding application 
logic in services, and boxing components and services in modules. Then you launch the app by 
bootstrapping the root module. Angular takes over, presenting your application content in a 
browser and responding to user interactions according to the instructions you've provided. 
Arguably, the most fundamental part of developing Angular applications are the components. A 
component is the combination of an HTML template and a component class that controls a 
portion of the screen. Here is an example of a component that displays a simple string: 
src/app/app.component.ts import { Component } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 
'my-app', template: ` 
Hello {{name}} 
` }) export class AppComponent { name = 'Angular'; } Every component begins with a 
@Component decorator function that takes a metadata object. The metadata object describes","['Who is the president of US?', ""Which contry is hosting the next winter olympic?""]","['Angular framework overview', 'Components and templates', 'TypeScript and metadata']"

` }) export class AppComponent { name = 'Angular'; } Every component begins with a 
@Component decorator function that takes a metadata object. The metadata object describes 
how the HTML template and component class work together. The selector property tells Angular 
to display the component inside a custom tag in the index.html file. index.html (inside the body 
tag) Loading AppComponent content here ... The template property defines a message inside a  
header. The message starts with ""Hello"" https://riptutorial.com/ 2 and ends with {{name}}, 
which is an Angular interpolation binding expression. At runtime, Angular replaces {{name}} 
with the value of the component's name property. Interpolation binding is one of many Angular 
features you'll discover in this documentation. In the example, change the component class's 
name property from 'Angular' to 'World' and see what happens. This example is written in 
TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. Angular uses TypeScript because its types make it easy to 
support developer productivity with tooling. Additionally, almost all support is for TypeScript 
and so using plain JavaScript to write your application will be difficult . Writing Angular code in 
JavaScript is possible, however; this guide explains how. More information on the architecture of
